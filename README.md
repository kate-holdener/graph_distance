# graph_distance
You are given a directed unweighted graph. Write a function that returns all nodes reachable from a given starting node and using no more than ```distance``` number of edges.

## Java
The function is
```
int [] getReachableNodes(int start, int distance)
```
The function should return an array of nodes reachable from ```start``` and using no more than ```distance``` edges. The ```start``` node should be included in that array.
## Python
The function is
```
get_reachable_nodes(self, start, distance)
```
The function should return a list containing all the nodes reachable from ```start``` and using no more than ```distance``` edges. The ```start``` node should be included in that list.
